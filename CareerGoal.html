      <h1 class="stuff">Get Smart: Setting Goals</h1>

      <hr>

      <h4 class="stuff">Goals, like dreams, are aspirational — but they are also more specific. In my opinion, I think that having a dream is important to many people; it gives us a direction to move towards. So, when people who has a dream, SHE/HE will set a goal to makes the dream be come true. A specific goal is a goal that has a bit of depth to it. It isn’t just say, you much take the action to acchive it. TO be specific is important, so you have to know exactly what needs to be done in order for the goal to be deemed a success.</h4>
