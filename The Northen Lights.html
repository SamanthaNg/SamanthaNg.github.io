<p>The OTHERWORLDLY AURORA <i>borealis,</i> or northern lights, beging high the Earth's atmosphere-at altitudes from 60 to more than 250 miles- when charged particles from the sun become trapped in the earth's magnetic field. The result is a colorful, dancing light show.</p>
<p>The first I filmed an aurora was from an icebreacker near antarctica. Luckily, there are more accessible places if you'd like to take in the shows yourself. For the best seats to this celestial scene, consider anywhere with a magnetic latitude above 55 Â° and low light pollution. Find oyur magnetic latitude on NOAA and here.</p>
<p>In the polar latitudes, auroras can appear aon any dark night. Long winter nights are good but not necessaryly the best time. Near equinixes in March and September, the Earth's magnetic field lets more solar particles interact with the atmosphere, creating aurora season! I suggest autumnal equinox in Setember, when there are pleasant temperatures in polar latitudes. Find the dark hours of your locaton here, or by using a sky guide app.</p>
